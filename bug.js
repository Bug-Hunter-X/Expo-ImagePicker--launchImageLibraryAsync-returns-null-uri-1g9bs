This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library.  The issue is that after selecting an image, the promise returned by launchImageLibraryAsync sometimes resolves with a null value for the uri property, even if the user successfully selected an image. This leads to unexpected behavior in the application, particularly when trying to use the selected image uri in further operations.
